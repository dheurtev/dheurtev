## Telecommunications ##
**Digital Leased lines**
Leased line services (or private line services) became digital in the 1970s with the conversion of the Bell backbone network from analog to digital circuits. This allowed AT&T to offer Dataphone Digital Services (later re-branded digital data services) that started the deployment of ISDN and T1 lines to customer premises to connect.[

#### Some Standards ####
- G.711 (1972) : a narrowband audio codec originally designed for use in telephony that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300–3400 Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: μ-law, which is used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in most other countries outside North America.
G.711 is an ITU-T standard (Recommendation) for audio companding, titled **Pulse code modulation (PCM)** of voice frequencies released for use in 1972. It is a required standard in many technologies, such as in the H.320 and H.323 standards.[1] It can also be used for fax communication over IP networks (as defined in T.38 specification).

- X.25 (1976) : ITU-T standard protocol suite for **packet-switched data communication in wide area networks (WAN)**. It was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.
Networks using X.25 were popular during the late 1970s and 1980s with **telecommunications companies** and in **financial transaction systems** such as automated teller machines. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical links. However, most users have moved to Internet Protocol (IP) systems instead. X.25 was used up to 2015 (e.g. by the credit card payment industry)[7] and is still used by aviation, purchasable from telecoms companies

## Networking ##
- Computer manufacturers developed **proprietary protocol suites** such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, and Xerox's Xerox Network Systems (XNS). During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, there remained a lack of open networking options. Therefore, proprietary standards, particularly SNA and DECnet, as well as some variants of XNS (e.g., Novell NetWare and Banyan VINES), were commonly used on private networks, becoming somewhat "de facto" industry standards.
The **X.25 standard** gained political support in European countries and from the European Economic Community (EEC). For example, the European Informatics Network, which was based on datagrams was replaced with Euronet based on X.25.[38] Peter Kirstein wrote that European networks tended to be short-term projects with smaller numbers of computers and users. As a result, the European networking activities did not lead to any strong standards except X.25 which became the main European data protocol for fifteen to twenty years.

##### Some protocols #####
- NCP - Network Control Protocol (1970) : First implementation for the ARPANET. Transport layer protocol used during the early ARPANET. Remained in use until 1982.

- **FTP - File Transfer Protocol (1971)** : standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of TCP/IP. Superseded by FTPS and SFTP.

- **TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (1974)** : transmission of packets (reception is certain). Essential to the internet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol
-  NAME/FINGER - Finger Protocol (1977) : simple network protocols for the exchange of human-oriented status and user information (insecure, obsolete) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)

#### Evolution of hardware ####
- Interdata 7/32 and 8/32 (1973).  Interdata computers are primarily remembered for being the **first 32-bit minicomputers** under $10,000 
The 7/32 and 8/32 became the computers of choice in large scale embedded systems, such as FFT machines used in real-time seismic analysis, CAT scanners, and flight simulator systems. They were also often used as non-IBM peripherals in IBM networks, serving the role of HASP workstations and spooling systems, so called RJE (Remote Job Entry) stations. For example, the computers behind the first Space Shuttle simulator consisted of thirty-six 32-bit minis inputting and/or outputting data to networked mainframe computers (both IBM and Univac), all in real-time.

- **Fist CPU - Intel (1971)** - The Intel 4004 was the world's first microprocessor—a complete general-purpose CPU on a single chip**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004

- When the **first general purpose microprocessor was introduced in 1974** it immediately began chipping away at the low end of the computer market, replacing embedded minicomputers in many industrial devices.

#### Evolution of mainframes ####
- By the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired **interactive user terminals**[NB 1] operating as **timesharing computers**, supporting **hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing**. Users gained access through **keyboard/typewriter terminals** and **specialized text terminal CRT displays with integral keyboards**, or **later from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software**

##### Some applications #####
- **File Transfer Protocol (1971)**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol
- **asymmetric public-private (1976)**: The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)
- **RSA (1977)**: RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. Patented in 1983.

- **Visicalc - First spreadsheet (1979)**
With the development of the VisiCalc application in 1979, microcomputers broke out of the factory and began entering office suites in large quantities, but still through the back door.
