# 1980 - 1989

## Telecommunications : L3, ISDN ##
With the extension of digital services in the 1980s, **leased lines were used to connect customer premises to frame relay or ATM networks**. Access data rates increased from the original T1 option with maximum transmission speed of 1.544 Mbit/s up to **T3 circuits**.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leased_line

**Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)** is a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the digitalised circuits of the public switched telephone network.[1] Work on the standard began in 1980 at Bell Labs and was formally standardized in 1988 in the CCITT "Red Book".
Prior to ISDN, the telephone system consisted of digital links like T1/E1 on the long-distance lines between telephone company offices and analog signals on copper telephone wires to the customers, the "last mile".

## Networking : NSFNET, protocol wars, emergence of TCP/IP ##
**NSFNET**
In the early 1980s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded national supercomputing centers at several universities in the United States, and provided interconnectivity in 1986 with the NSFNET project, thus creating network access to these supercomputer sites for research and academic organizations in the United States. International connections to NSFNET, the emergence of architecture such as the Domain Name System, and the adoption of TCP/IP internationally on existing networks marked the beginnings of the Internet.[6][7][8] Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.[9] The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.[10] Limited private connections to parts of the Internet by officially commercial entities emerged in several American cities by late 1989 and 199

**OSI Model vs. TCP/IP War**
Hubert Zimmermann, and Charles Bachman as chairman, played a key role in the development of the Open Systems Interconnections reference model. Beginning in 1978, this international work led to a draft proposal in 1980 and the final OSI model was published in 1984.
The early research and development of standards for data networks and protocols culminated in the Internet–OSI Standards War in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Beginning in the early 1980s, ARPA pursued commercial partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry which enabled the adoption of TCP/IP. In Europe, CERN purchased UNIX machines with TCP/IP for their intranet between 1984 and 1988
At the beginning of the 1990s, academic institutions and organizations in some European countries had adopted TCP/IP.[nb 6] In February 1990 RARE stated "without putting into question its OSI policy, recognizes the TCP/IP family of protocols as an open multivendor suite, well adapted to scientific and technical applications." In the same month, CERN established a transatlantic TCP/IP link with Cornell University in the United States.[53][67] Conversely, starting in August 1990, the NSFNET backbone supported the OSI Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) in addition to TCP/IP.

## Cryptography : public key certificates ##
- **RSA Patent granted (1983)**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)
- **X.509 (1988)** : In cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard defining the format of public key certificates.[1] X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for HTTPS,[2] the secure protocol for browsing the web. They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.

### Evolution of mainframes : graphic display, terminal emulation, emergence of mini computers and departmental computers ###

By the 1980s, many mainframes supported **graphic display terminals**, and **terminal emulation**, but not graphical user interfaces. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer

Shrinking demand and tough competition started a shakeout in the market in the early 1970s—RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell; between 1986 and 1990 Honeywell was bought out by Bull; UNIVAC became a division of Sperry, which later merged with Burroughs to form Unisys Corporation in 1986.
In 1984 estimated sales of desktop computers ($11.6 billion) exceeded mainframe computers ($11.4 billion) for the first time. IBM received the vast majority of mainframe revenue.[19] During the 1980s, minicomputer-based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower end of the mainframes. These computers, sometimes called departmental computers, were typified by the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX series.
