## Inventions
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

- **STN passove matrix LCD screens invention (1983) - Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) Research Center**

In 1983, researchers at Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) Research Center, Switzerland, invented the super-twisted nematic (STN) structure for passive matrix-addressed LCDs. H. Amstutz et al. were listed as inventors in the corresponding patent applications filed in Switzerland on July 7, 1983, and October 28, 1983. Patents were granted in Switzerland CH 665491, Europe EP 0131216,[68] U.S. Patent 4,634,229 and many more countries. In 1980, Brown Boveri started a 50/50 joint venture with the Dutch Philips company, called Videlec.[69] Philips had the required know-how to design and build integrated circuits for the control of large LCD panels. In addition, Philips had better access to markets for electronic components and intended to use LCDs in new product generations of hi-fi, video equipment and telephones. In 1984, Philips researchers Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan invented a video speed-drive scheme that solved the slow response time of STN-LCDs, enabling high-resolution, high-quality, and smooth-moving video images on STN-LCDs.[70] In 1985, Philips inventors Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan solved the problem of driving high-resolution STN-LCDs using low-voltage (CMOS-based) drive electronics, allowing the application of high-quality (high resolution and video speed) LCD panels in battery-operated portable products like notebook computers and mobile phones.[71] In 1985, Philips acquired 100% of the Videlec AG company based in Switzerland. Afterwards, Philips moved the Videlec production lines to the Netherlands. Years later, Philips successfully produced and marketed complete modules (consisting of the LCD screen, microphone, speakers etc.) in high-volume production for the booming mobile phone industry.

- **first practical organic LED (OLED) device (1987) - Eastman Kodak**

Chemists Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak built the first practical OLED device in 1987.[28] This device used a two-layer structure with separate hole transporting and electron transporting layers such that recombination and light emission occurred in the middle of the organic layer; this resulted in a reduction in operating voltage and improvements in efficiency.

- **Larger (14") TFT screens (1988) - Sharp**

In 1988, a Sharp research team led by engineer T. Nagayasu demonstrated a 14-inch full-color LCD display,[10][18] which convinced the electronics industry that LCD would eventually replace CRTs as the standard television display technology.[10]

- **first commercially available blue LED based on the indirect bandgap semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC) (1989) - Cree**

In August 1989, Cree introduced the first commercially available blue LED based on the indirect bandgap semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC).[43] SiC LEDs had very low efficiency, no more than about 0.03%, but did emit in the blue portion of the visible light spectrum.[44][45]

In cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard defining the format of public key certificates.[1] X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for HTTPS,[2] the secure protocol for browsing the web. They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.

- **Symbolic computing and graphing calculators - HP, Casio**

The first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the HP-28C, released in 1987. It could, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. 

The first graphing calculator was the Casio fx-7000G released in 1985.

- **Starcom Cable TV Converter - infrared LED remote controls (1980) - Jerrold Electronics / General Instrument**

In 1980, the most popular remote control was the Starcom Cable TV Converter[25] (from Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument)[13] which used 40-kHz sound to change channels. Then, a Canadian company, Viewstar, Inc., was formed by engineer Paul Hrivnak and started producing a cable TV converter with an infrared remote control. The product was sold through Philips for approximately $190 CAD. The Viewstar converter was an immediate success, the millionth converter being sold on March 21, 1985, with 1.6 million sold by 1989.[26][27]

- **Pocket LCD TVs (1982) - Seiko Epson**

The first color LCD televisions were developed as handheld televisions in Japan. In 1980, Hattori Seiko's R&D group began development on color LCD pocket televisions.[72] In 1982, Seiko Epson released the first LCD television, the Epson TV Watch, a wristwatch equipped with a small active-matrix LCD television.[73][74] Sharp Corporation introduced dot matrix TN-LCD in 1983.[62] In 1984, Epson released the ET-10, the first full-color, pocket LCD television.[75] The same year, Citizen Watch,[76] introduced the Citizen Pocket TV,[72] a 2.7-inch color LCD TV,[76] with the first commercial TFT LCD.[72] In 1988, Sharp demonstrated a 14-inch, active-matrix, full-color, full-motion TFT-LCD. This led to Japan launching an LCD industry, which developed large-size LCDs, including TFT computer monitors and LCD televisions.[77] Epson developed the 3LCD projection technology in the 1980s, and licensed it for use in projectors in 1988.[78] Epson's VPJ-700, released in January 1989, was the world's first compact, full-color LCD projector.[74]

- **Sony CDP-101 - Audio compact disk player (1982) - Sony**

Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA or CD-DA), also known as Digital Audio Compact Disc or simply as Audio CD, is the standard format for audio compact discs. The standard is defined in the Red Book, one of a series of Rainbow Books (named for their binding colors) that contain the technical specifications for all CD formats.

The first commercially available audio CD player, the Sony CDP-101, was released October 1982 in Japan. The format gained worldwide acceptance in 1983â€“84, selling more than a million CD players in those two years, to play 22.5 million discs.[1]

Beginning in the 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50% from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry.

- **Orange monochrome plasma displays for laptops (1983) - IBM**

In 1983, IBM introduced a 19-inch (48 cm) orange-on-black monochrome display (Model 3290 Information Panel) which was able to show up to four simultaneous IBM 3270 terminal sessions. By the end of the decade, orange monochrome plasma displays were used in a number of high-end AC-powered portable computers, such as the Compaq Portable 386 (1987) and the IBM P75 (1990). Plasma displays had a better contrast ratio, viewability angle, and less motion blur than the LCDs that were available at the time, and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color LCD displays in 1992.[59]

Due to heavy competition from monochrome LCDs used in laptops and the high costs of plasma display technology, in 1987 IBM planned to shut down its factory in Kingston, New York, the largest plasma plant in the world, in favor of manufacturing mainframe computers, which would have left development to Japanese companies.[60] Dr. Larry F. Weber, a University of Illinois ECE PhD (in plasma display research) and staff scientist working at CERL (home of the PLATO System), co-founded Plasmaco with Stephen Globus and IBM plant manager James Kehoe, and bought the plant from IBM for US$50,000. Weber stayed in Urbana as CTO until 1990, then moved to upstate New York to work at Plasmaco.

- **Flat screen CRT TV (1987) - Zenith**

In 1987, flat-screen CRTs were developed by Zenith for computer monitors, reducing reflections and helping increase image contrast and brightness.[63][64] Such CRTs were expensive, which limited their use to computer monitors.[65] Attempts were made to produce flat-screen CRTs using inexpensive and widely available float glass.[66]

- **SVGA Graphics Cards (1988)**

In the late 1980s, after the release of IBM's VGA, third-party manufacturers began making graphics cards based on its specifications with extended capabilities. As these cards grew in popularity they began to be referred to as "Super VGA."
This term was not an official standard, but a shorthand for enhanced VGA cards which had become common by 1988.[1] One card that explicitly used the term was **Genoa's SuperVGA HiRes.**[3]
Super VGA cards broke compatibility with the IBM VGA standard, requiring software developers to provide specific display drivers and implementations for each card their software could operate on.

### Broadcast
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

- **TVRO/C-band satellite era (1980â€“1986)**

On 26 April 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later Sky One), was launched.[68] Its signals were transmitted from the ESA's Orbital Test Satellites
Originally, all channels were broadcast in the clear (ITC) because the equipment necessary to receive the programming was too expensive for consumers. With the growing number of TVRO systems, the program providers and broadcasters had to scramble their signal and develop subscription systems.
In January 1986, HBO began using the now-obsolete VideoCipher II system to encrypt their channels.
On 11 December 1988 Luxembourg launched Astra 1A, the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe.[75] This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in Ku band and allowing reception with small(90 cm) dishes for the first time ever.

- **HD-MAC - last analog HDTV system (1986)**

In 1986, the European Community proposed HD-MAC, an analog HDTV system with 1,152 lines. A public demonstration took place for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. However HD-MAC was scrapped in 1993 and the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) project was formed, which would foresee development of a digital HDTV standard.[7]

### Video games
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

- **Golden age : Move of arcade games to microprocessors (1978-1983)**

As technology moved from transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits to microprocessors, a new wave of arcade video games arose, starting with Taito's **Space Invaders** in 1978 and leading to a golden age of arcade video games that included **Pac-Man** (Namco, 1980), **Missile Command** (Atari, 1980), and **Donkey Kong (Nintendo, 1981)**. The golden age waned in 1983 due to an excess number of arcade games, the growing draw of home video game consoles and computers, and a moral panic on the impact of arcade video games on youth.[22][57] The arcade industry was also partially impacted by the video game crash of 1983.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game#History

Space Invaders led off what is considered to be the golden age of arcade games which lasted from 1978 to 1982. Several influential and best-selling arcade games were released during this period from Atari, Namco, Taito, Williams, and Nintendo, including Asteroids (1979), Galaxian (1979), Defender (1980), Missile Command (1980), Tempest (1981), and Galaga (1981). Pac-Man, released in 1980, became a popular culture icon, and a new wave of games appeared that focused on identifiable characters and alternate mechanics such as navigating a maze or traversing a series of platforms. Aside from Pac-Man and its sequel, Ms. Pac-Man (1982), the most popular games in this vein during the golden age were Donkey Kong (1981) and Q*bert (1982).[14] Games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Q*bert also introduced the **concept of narratives and characters to video games**, which led companies to adopt these later as mascots for marketing purposes.[17][18]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games

- **Second generation consoles, shift to Japan and new gaming industry model**

At the start of the second generation, all games were developed and produced in-house. Four former Atari programmers, having left from conflicts in management style after Atari was purchased by Warner Communications in 1976, established Activision in 1979 to develop their own VCS games, which included Kaboom! and Pitfall!. Atari sued Activision on the basis of theft of trade secrets and violation of their non-disclosure agreements, but the two companies settled out of court in 1982, with Activision agreeing to pay a small license fee to Atari for every game of theirs their sold. This established Activision as the first third-party developer for a console. This also established a working model for licensing other third-party developers, which several companies followed in Activision's wake, partially contributing to the video game crash of 1983 due to oversaturation.[19]

As the second generation of consoles coincided with the golden age of arcade video games, a common trend that emerged during the generation was licensing arcade video games for consoles. Many of them were increasingly licensed from Japanese video game companies by 1980, which led to Jonathan Greenberg of Forbes predicting in early 1981 that Japanese companies would eventually dominate the North American video game industry later in the decade.[20]

At this stage, both consoles and game cartridges were intended to be sold for profit by manufacturers. However, by segregating games from the console, this approach established the use of the razorblade business model in future console generations, where consoles would be sold at or below cost while licensing fees from third-party games would bring in profits.[21][22]

- **8 bits game consoles - Third generation video games consoles (1983)**

In the history of video games, the third generation of game consoles, commonly referred to as the 8-bit era, began on July 15, 1983 with the Japanese release of two systems: Nintendo's Family Computer (commonly abbreviated to **Famicom**) and **Sega's SG-1000**.[1][2] When the Famicom was released outside of Japan it was remodelled and marketed as the **Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)**. This generation marked the end of the video game crash of 1983, and a shift in the dominance of home video game manufacturers from the United States to Japan.[3] Handheld consoles were not a major part of this generation, although the Game & Watch line from Nintendo (which started in 1980) and the Milton Bradley Microvision (which came out in 1979) were sold at the time. However, both are considered second generation hardware.
The best-selling console of this generation was the **NES/Famicom** from Nintendo, followed by the **Sega Master System** (the improved successor to the SG-1000), and the **Atari 7800**. Although the previous generation of consoles had also used 8-bit processors, it was at the end of the third generation that home consoles were first labeled and marketed by their "bits".

- **16 bits game consoles - Fourth generation video games consoles (1987)**

In the history of video games, the fourth generation of game consoles, more commonly referred to as the 16-bit era, began on October 30, 1987, with the Japanese release of **NEC Home Electronics**' PC Engine (known as the TurboGrafx-16 in North America).
Although NEC released the first console of this era, sales were mostly dominated by the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo across most markets: the Sega Mega Drive (named the Sega Genesis in North America) and the **Super Nintendo Entertainment System **(SNES; the Super Famicom in Japan). Cartridge-based handheld consoles became prominent during this time, dominated by the **Nintendo Game Boy** (1989). Color handhelds were also released, including the Atari Lynx (1989) and Sega Game Gear (1990).

The first handheld game console released in the fourth generation was the Game Boy, on April 21, 1989. It went on to dominate handheld sales by an extremely large margin, despite featuring a 8-bit microprocessor and a low-contrast, unlit monochrome screen while all three of its leading competitors had color. Three major franchises made their debut on the Game Boy: Tetris, the Game Boy's killer application; PokÃ©mon; and Kirby. With some design (Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light) and hardware (Game Boy Color) changes, it continued in production in some form until 2008, enjoying a better than 18-year run.

Cartridge-based handheld consoles became prominent during this time, dominated by the Nintendo Game Boy (1989).
Color handhelds were also released, including the Atari Lynx (1989) and Sega Game Gear (1990).

- **Recovery and decline of the arcade market (1986-1989)**

The arcade market had recovered by 1986, with the help of software conversion kits, the arrival of popular **beat 'em up games** (such as Kung-Fu Master and Renegade), and advanced motion simulator games (such as Sega's "taikan" games including Hang-On, Space Harrier and Out Run). However, the growth of home video game systems such as the Nintendo Entertainment System led to another brief arcade decline towards the end of the 1980s

**Decision to open GPS to civilian use and deployment of modern GPS satellites**

In 1983, after Soviet interceptor aircraft shot down the civilian airliner KAL 007 that strayed into prohibited airspace because of navigational errors, killing all 269 people on board, U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced that GPS would be made available for civilian uses once it was completed,[54][55] although it had been previously published in Navigation magazine, and that the CA code (Coarse/Acquisition code) would be available to civilian users.[citation needed]

By 1985, ten more experimental Block-I satellites had been launched to validate the concept.

Beginning in 1988, command and control of these satellites was moved from Onizuka AFS, California to the 2nd Satellite Control Squadron (2SCS) located at Falcon Air Force Station in Colorado Springs, Colorado.[56][57]

On February 14, 1989, the first modern Block-II satellite was launched.
