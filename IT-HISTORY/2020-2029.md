- **XBox Series - SSD, 4K  and away from optic drive (2020) - Microsoft**

The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S (collectively, the Xbox Series X/S[b]) are home video game consoles developed by Microsoft. They were both released on November 10, 2020, as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding the Xbox One. Along with Sony's PlayStation 5, also released in November 2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.[3]

As with the Xbox One line, the consoles utilize an AMD CPU and GPU. Both models feature a new storage architecture based around solid-state drives to reduce loading times, support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and spatial audio, the ability to convert games to high-dynamic-range (HDR) color using machine learning ("Auto HDR"), support for HDMI 2.1 variable refresh rate and low-latency modes, and updated controllers. Xbox Series X was designed to nominally render games in 2160p (4K resolution) at 60 frames per second (FPS). The lower-end Xbox Series S, which has reduced specifications and does not include an optical drive, was designed to nominally render games in 1440p at 60 FPS, with support for 4K upscaling.

- **Sony PlayStation 5 - Fastest selling Playstation (2020) - Sony**

The latest console in the series, the PlayStation 5, was released in 2020[6] and sold 10 million units in its first 249 days, unseating its predecessor as the fastest-selling PlayStation console to-date.[7]

The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, allowing it to serve as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games through digital download. The two variants were launched simultaneously.

The PlayStation 5's main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.

The PlayStation 5 was generally well received at launch, with much praise of its DualSense controller's improved haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

## Some standards

### Data layer

- Y.3800 (2020) 

an ITU-T Recommendation (computer standard) with the long name "Overview on networks supporting quantum key distribution", that gives an overview of networks supporting quantum key distribution (QKD) cryptographic protocols.[1

- **Terabit Ethernet**

The IEEE 802.3cm standard was approved on January 30, 2020 for 802.3cm	2020-01	400 Gbit/s over multimode fiber (four and eight pairs, 100 m)

The IEEE 802.3cu standard was approved on February 11, 2021 for 802.3cu	2021-02	100 Gbit/s and 400 Gbit/s over SMF using 100 Gbit/s lanes
