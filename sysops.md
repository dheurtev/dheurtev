# My picks for system operations (sysops) -  Platform As A Service (PAAS) and cattle management

- [Monitor](#monitor)
- [Other tools](#other-tools)

## Best practices ##
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**
- Infrastructure should be reproductible, disposable, consistent, with no end state
- Better to build and deploy server images often to avoid drift accumulation
- Immutable configuration to avoid configuration drift
- Do not store passwords in code. Use instead IAM or Vault. 
- Send and monitor logs
