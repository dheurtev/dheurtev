Since the 2010s, die shrink and improved transistor density have allowed for increasing chipset integration, and the functions performed by northbridges are now often incorporated into other components (like southbridges or CPUs themselves).[3][4] As of 2019, Intel and AMD had both released chipsets in which all northbridge functions had been integrated into the CPU.[4] Modern Intel Core processors have the northbridge integrated on the CPU die, where it is known as the uncore or system agent.
