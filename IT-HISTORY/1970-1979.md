# 1970s : Digital phone, proprietary networking, CPUs, birth of moder cryptography, printers, PCs and expansion of satellite TV

## Telecommunications
- **Conversion of the Bell backbone from analog to digital, Digital leased lines**
Leased line services (or private line services) became digital in the 1970s with the conversion of the Bell backbone network from analog to digital circuits. This allowed AT&T to offer Dataphone Digital Services (later re-branded digital data services) that started the deployment of ISDN and T1 lines to customer premises to connect

## Networking
- **Proprietary protocol suites**
Computer manufacturers developed **proprietary protocol suites** such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, and Xerox's Xerox Network Systems (XNS). During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, there remained a lack of open networking options. Therefore, proprietary standards, particularly SNA and DECnet, as well as some variants of XNS (e.g., Novell NetWare and Banyan VINES), were commonly used on private networks, becoming somewhat "de facto" industry standards.

- **X.25 standard**
The X.25 standard gained political support in European countries and from the European Economic Community (EEC). For example, the European Informatics Network, which was based on datagrams was replaced with Euronet based on X.25.[38] Peter Kirstein wrote that European networks tended to be short-term projects with smaller numbers of computers and users. As a result, the European networking activities did not lead to any strong standards except X.25 which became the main European data protocol for fifteen to twenty years.

## Cryptography
- **DES - symmetric key (1975-1977)**
The Data Encryption Standard (DES /ˌdiːˌiːˈɛs, dɛz/) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.
Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.[2]

- **asymmetric public-private key (1976) - Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman**: The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)
- **RSA (1977) - Rivest–Shamir–Adleman**: a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. Patented in 1983.

## Computers

### Evolution of hardware

- **Datapoint 2200 (1970) - Datapoint**
Released in June 1970, the programmable terminal called the Datapoint 2200 is among the **earliest known devices that bears significant resemblance to the modern personal computer, with a CRT screen, keyboard, programmability, and program storage**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers

- **Dot matrix printer (1970) - Centronics**
An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson began development of a low-cost printer at Centronics, a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories that produced specialty computer terminals. The printer used the dot matrix printing principle, with a print head consisting of a vertical row of seven metal pins connected to solenoids. When power was applied to the solenoids, the pin was pushed forward to strike the paper and leave a dot. To make a complete character glyph, the print head would receive power to specified pins to create a single vertical pattern, then the print head would move to the right by a small amount, and the process repeated. On their original design, a typical glyph was printed as a matrix seven high and five wide, while the "A" models used a print head with 9 pins and formed glyphs that were 9 by 7.[2]
This left the problem of sending the ASCII data to the printer. While a serial port does so with the minimum of pins and wires, it requires the device to buffer up the data as it arrives bit by bit and turn it back into multi-bit values. A parallel port makes this simpler; the entire ASCII value is presented on the pins in complete form. In addition to the eight data pins, the system also needed various control pins as well as electrical grounds. Wang happened to have a surplus stock of 20,000 Amphenol 36-pin micro ribbon connectors that were originally used for one of their early calculators. The interface only required 21 of these pins, the rest were grounded or not connected. The connector has become so closely associated with Centronics that it is now popularly known as the "Centronics connector".[3]
The Centronics Model 101 printer, featuring this connector, was released in 1970.[3]
The printer side of the interface quickly became an industry de facto standard, but manufacturers used various connectors on the system side, so a variety of cables were required. For example, NCR used the 36-pin micro ribbon connector on both ends of the connection, early VAX systems used a DC-37 connector, Texas Instruments used a 25-pin card edge connector and Data General used a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. When IBM implemented the parallel interface on the IBM PC, they used the DB-25F connector at the PC-end of the interface, creating the now familiar parallel cable with a DB25M at one end and a 36-pin micro ribbon connector at the other.

- **Intel Intel 1702A 2K (256 x 8) UV Erasable PROM - First EPROM (1971) - Intel**
An EPROM (rarely EROM), or erasable programmable read-only memory, is a type of programmable read-only memory (PROM) chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off. Computer memory that can retrieve stored data after a power supply has been turned off and back on is called non-volatile. It is an array of floating-gate transistors individually programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than those normally used in digital circuits. Once programmed, an EPROM can be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet light source (such as from a mercury-vapor lamp). EPROMs are easily recognizable by the transparent fused quartz (or on later models resin) window on the top of the package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to ultraviolet light during erasing

- **Intel 4004 - Fist CPU (1971) - Intel** - The Intel 4004 was the world's first microprocessor—a complete general-purpose CPU on a single chip
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004
When the first general purpose microprocessor was introduced in 1971 (Intel 4004) it immediately began chipping away at the low end of the computer market, replacing embedded minicomputers in many industrial devices.

- **EEPROM - electrically re-programmable non-volatile memory (1972) Toshiba**
In 1972, a type of electrically re-programmable non-volatile memory was invented by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba, who is also known as the inventor of flash memory.[12] Most of the major semiconductor manufactures, such as Toshiba,[12][6] Sanyo (later, ON Semiconductor),[13] IBM,[14] Intel,[15][16] NEC (later, Renesas Electronics),[17] Philips (later, NXP Semiconductors),[18] Siemens (later, Infineon Technologies),[19] Honeywell (later, Atmel),[20] Texas Instruments,[21] studied, invented, and manufactured some electrically re-programmable non-volatile devices until 1977.

- **Winchester - disk platter hard drive (1973) - IBM**
In 1973, IBM introduced a new type of HDD code-named "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to "land" on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, "taking off" again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of "Winchester technology" drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later "Winchester" drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.

- **Xerox Alto - First computers designed for individual use (1973) - Xerox**
The Xerox Alto was one of the first computers designed for individual use in 1973 and is regarded as the **first modern computer to use a mouse**.[48] Inspired by PARC's Alto, the Lilith, a computer which had been developed by a team around Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich between 1978 and 1980, provided a mouse as well. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse
In the 1970s, Engelbart's ideas were further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at Xerox PARC and specifically Alan Kay, who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used a GUI as the main interface for the Smalltalk programming language, which ran on the Xerox Alto computer, released in 1973. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system.

- **Interdata 7/32 and 8/32 - first 32-bit minicomputers under $10,000 (1973) - Interdata** 
Interdata computers are primarily remembered for being the first 32-bit minicomputers under $10,000 
The 7/32 and 8/32 became the computers of choice in large scale embedded systems, such as FFT machines used in real-time seismic analysis, CAT scanners, and flight simulator systems. They were also often used as non-IBM peripherals in IBM networks, serving the role of HASP workstations and spooling systems, so called RJE (Remote Job Entry) stations. For example, the computers behind the first Space Shuttle simulator consisted of thirty-six 32-bit minis inputting and/or outputting data to networked mainframe computers (both IBM and Univac), all in real-time.

- **Swinging arm actuator (1974) - IBM**
In 1974 IBM introduced the swinging arm actuator, made feasible because the Winchester recording heads function well when skewed to the recorded tracks. The simple design of the IBM GV (Gulliver) drive,[44] invented at IBM's UK Hursley Labs, became IBM's most licensed electro-mechanical invention[45] of all time, the actuator and filtration system being adopted in the 1980s eventually for all HDDs, and still universal nearly 40 years and 10 Billion arms later.

- **DIN connector (1974)**
The DIN connector is an electrical connector that was originally standardized in the early 1970s[1] by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN), the German national standards organization. There are DIN standards for various different connectors.

- **Bios (1975) - CP/M operating system - Digital Research, Inc.**
In computing, BIOS (/ˈbaɪɒs, -oʊs/, BY-oss, -⁠ohss; Basic Input/Output System (also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS, BIOS ROM or PC BIOS) is firmware used to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs and to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup).[1] The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on an IBM PC or IBM PC compatible's system board and exists in UEFI-based systems too.[2][3] The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975.[4][5] The BIOS originally proprietary to the IBM PC has been reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems. The interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard.

- **Apple II - First commodity-like microcomputer, uses a 5 1/4 floppy disk(1977) - Apple**
By 1976, there were several firms racing to introduce the first truly successful commercial personal computers**. Three machines, the Apple II, PET 2001 and TRS-80 were all released in 1977,[34] becoming the most popular by late 1978.[35] Byte magazine later referred to Commodore, Apple, and Tandy as the "1977 Trinity".[36] Also in 1977, Sord Computer Corporation released the Sord M200 Smart Home Computer in Japan.[37]
  * **Apple** is founded in 1976.

- **TV screens used as computer screens**
Many personal computers introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s were designed to use television receivers as their display devices, making the resolutions dependent on the television standards in use, including PAL and NTSC. Picture sizes were usually limited to ensure the visibility of all the pixels in the major television standards and the broad range of television sets with varying amounts of over scan. The actual drawable picture area was, therefore, somewhat smaller than the whole screen, and was usually surrounded by a static-colored border (see image to right). Also, the interlace scanning was usually omitted in order to provide more stability to the picture, effectively halving the vertical resolution in progress. 160 × 200, 320 × 200 and 640 × 200 on NTSC were relatively common resolutions in the era (224, 240 or 256 scanlines were also common). In the IBM PC world, these resolutions came to be used by 16-color EGA video cards.
One of the drawbacks of using a classic television is that the computer display resolution is higher than the television could decode. Chroma resolution for NTSC/PAL televisions are bandwidth-limited to a maximum 1.5 MHz, or approximately 160 pixels wide, which led to blurring of the color for 320- or 640-wide signals, and made text difficult to read (see example image below). Many users upgraded to higher-quality televisions with S-Video or RGBI inputs that helped eliminate chroma blur and produce more legible displays. The earliest, lowest cost solution to the chroma problem was offered in the Atari 2600 Video Computer System and the Apple II+, both of which offered the option to disable the color and view a legacy black-and-white signal. On the Commodore 64, the GEOS mirrored the Mac OS method of using black-and-white to improve readability.

Digital HDTV was made possible by the development of discrete cosine transform (DCT) video compression.[25][23] DCT coding is a lossy image compression technique that was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972,

- **Anik1 - First North American commercial satelitte to carry tv tranmissions (1972)**
The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972.[48] ATS-6, the world's first experimental educational and direct broadcast satellite (DBS), was launched on 30 May 1974.[49] It transmitted at 860 MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels. The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use.[50]

The first in a series of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry direct-to-home television, Ekran 1, was launched on 26 October 1976.[51] It used a 714 MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than microwave technology.[52]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television

- **Beginning of the satellite TV industry (1976–1980)**
The satellite television industry developed first in the US from the cable television industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote cable television headends. Home Box Office (HBO), Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), and Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN, later The Family Channel) were among the first to use satellite television to deliver programming. Taylor Howard of San Andreas, California, became the first person to receive C-band satellite signals with his home-built system in 1976.[53]

In the US, PBS, a non-profit public broadcasting service, began to distribute its television programming by satellite in 1978.[54]

In 1979, Soviet engineers developed the Moskva (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signals via satellites. They launched the Gorizont communication satellites later that same year. These satellites used geostationary orbits.[55] They were equipped with powerful on-board transponders, so the size of receiving parabolic antennas of downlink stations was reduced to 4 and 2.5 metres.[55] On October 18, 1979, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began allowing people to have home satellite earth stations without a federal government license.[56] The front cover of the 1979 Neiman-Marcus Christmas catalogue featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale for $36,500.[57] The dishes were nearly 20 feet (6.1 m) in diameter[58] and were remote controlled.[59] The price went down by half soon after that, but there were only eight more channels.[60] The Society for Private and Commercial Earth Stations (SPACE), an organisation which represented consumers and satellite TV system owners, was established in 1980.[61]

Early satellite television systems were not very popular due to their expense and large dish size.[62] The satellite television dishes of the systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s were 10 to 16 feet (3.0 to 4.9 m) in diameter,[63] made of fibreglass or solid aluminum or steel,[64] and in the United States cost more than $5,000, sometimes as much as $10,000.[65] Programming sent from ground stations was relayed from eighteen satellites in geostationary orbit located 22,300 miles (35,900 km) above the Earth.[66][67]

By 1980, satellite television was well established in the USA and Europe.

### Automation
- **Remote control for light and applicances (1974) -  Pico Electronics / Birmingham Sound Reproducers** 
In 1974, the Pico engineers jointly developed a LP record turntable, the ADC Accutrac 4000, with Birmingham Sound Reproducers, at the time the largest manufacturer of record changers in the world. It could be programmed to play selected tracks, and could be operated by a remote control using ultrasound signals, which sparked the idea of remote control for lights and appliances. By 1975, the X10 project was conceived, so named because it was the tenth project. In 1978, X10 products started to appear in RadioShack and Sears stores. Together with BSR a partnership was formed, with the name X10 Ltd. At that time the system consisted of a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.

## Standards, languages and protocols : X.10 home automation, X.25 packet switching, FTP, TCP ##

### Network layer ###
- **X.10 (1975)**
X10 is a protocol for **communication among electronic devices used for home automation (domotics)**. It primarily uses power line wiring for signaling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts representing digital information. A wireless radio-based protocol transport is also defined. X10 was developed in 1975 by Pico Electronics of Glenrothes, Scotland, in order to allow remote control of home devices and appliances. It was the first general purpose domotic network technology and remains the most widely available[citation needed].[1]
Although a number of higher-bandwidth alternatives exist, X10 remains popular in the home environment with millions of units in use worldwide, and inexpensive availability of new components.

- **X.25 (1976)**
ITU-T standard protocol suite for **packet-switched data communication in wide area networks (WAN)**. It was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.
Networks using X.25 were popular during the late 1970s and 1980s with **telecommunications companies** and in **financial transaction systems** such as automated teller machines. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical links. However, most users have moved to Internet Protocol (IP) systems instead. X.25 was used up to 2015 (e.g. by the credit card payment industry)[7] and is still used by aviation, purchasable from telecoms companies
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25

### Transport layer ###
- **NCP - Network Control Protocol (1970)**
First implementation for the ARPANET. Transport layer protocol used during the early ARPANET. Remained in use until 1982.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Protocol_(ARPANET)
- **TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (1974)**
transmission of packets (reception is certain). Essential to the internet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol

### Application layer ###
- **FTP - File Transfer Protocol (1971)**
standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of TCP/IP. Superseded by FTPS and SFTP.

- **G.711 (1972) : a narrowband audio codec**
originally designed for use in telephony that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300–3400 Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: μ-law, which is used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in most other countries outside North America.
G.711 is an ITU-T standard (Recommendation) for audio companding, titled **Pulse code modulation (PCM)** of voice frequencies released for use in 1972. It is a required standard in many technologies, such as in the H.320 and H.323 standards.[1] It can also be used for fax communication over IP networks (as defined in T.38 specification).
