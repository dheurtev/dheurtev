# 1970s

## Telecommunications : Conversion of the Bell backbone from analog to digital, Digital leased lines ##
Leased line services (or private line services) became digital in the 1970s with the conversion of the Bell backbone network from analog to digital circuits. This allowed AT&T to offer Dataphone Digital Services (later re-branded digital data services) that started the deployment of ISDN and T1 lines to customer premises to connect.[

## Networking : proprietary protocol suites, X.25 standard ##
- Computer manufacturers developed **proprietary protocol suites** such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, and Xerox's Xerox Network Systems (XNS). During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, there remained a lack of open networking options. Therefore, proprietary standards, particularly SNA and DECnet, as well as some variants of XNS (e.g., Novell NetWare and Banyan VINES), were commonly used on private networks, becoming somewhat "de facto" industry standards.
The **X.25 standard** gained political support in European countries and from the European Economic Community (EEC). For example, the European Informatics Network, which was based on datagrams was replaced with Euronet based on X.25.[38] Peter Kirstein wrote that European networks tended to be short-term projects with smaller numbers of computers and users. As a result, the European networking activities did not lead to any strong standards except X.25 which became the main European data protocol for fifteen to twenty years.

## Cryptography : Invention of the asymmetric key ##
- **asymmetric public-private key (1976)** - Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman **: The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976.

- **RSA (1977) - Rivest–Shamir–Adleman**: a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. Patented in 1983.

- **Interdata 7/32 and 8/32 (1973) - Interdata**.  Interdata computers are primarily remembered for being the **first 32-bit minicomputers** under $10,000 
The 7/32 and 8/32 became the computers of choice in large scale embedded systems, such as FFT machines used in real-time seismic analysis, CAT scanners, and flight simulator systems. They were also often used as non-IBM peripherals in IBM networks, serving the role of HASP workstations and spooling systems, so called RJE (Remote Job Entry) stations. For example, the computers behind the first Space Shuttle simulator consisted of thirty-six 32-bit minis inputting and/or outputting data to networked mainframe computers (both IBM and Univac), all in real-time.

- **Remote control for light and applicances (1974) -  Pico Electronics / Birmingham Sound Reproducers** 
In 1974, the Pico engineers jointly developed a LP record turntable, the ADC Accutrac 4000, with Birmingham Sound Reproducers, at the time the largest manufacturer of record changers in the world. It could be programmed to play selected tracks, and could be operated by a remote control using ultrasound signals, which sparked the idea of remote control for lights and appliances. By 1975, the X10 project was conceived, so named because it was the tenth project. In 1978, X10 products started to appear in RadioShack and Sears stores. Together with BSR a partnership was formed, with the name X10 Ltd. At that time the system consisted of a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.

- **By 1976, there were several firms racing to introduce the first truly successful commercial personal computers**. Three machines, the Apple II, PET 2001 and TRS-80 were all released in 1977,[34] becoming the most popular by late 1978.[35] Byte magazine later referred to Commodore, Apple, and Tandy as the "1977 Trinity".[36] Also in 1977, Sord Computer Corporation released the Sord M200 Smart Home Computer in Japan.[37]

## Standards, languages and protocols : X.25 packet switching, FTP, TCP ##

### Telecommunications : X.25 packet switching ###

### Network layer ###
- **X.10 (1975)** : X10 is a protocol for **communication among electronic devices used for home automation (domotics)**. It primarily uses power line wiring for signaling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts representing digital information. A wireless radio-based protocol transport is also defined. X10 was developed in 1975 by Pico Electronics of Glenrothes, Scotland, in order to allow remote control of home devices and appliances. It was the first general purpose domotic network technology and remains the most widely available[citation needed].[1]
Although a number of higher-bandwidth alternatives exist, X10 remains popular in the home environment with millions of units in use worldwide, and inexpensive availability of new components.

- **X.25 (1976)** : ITU-T standard protocol suite for **packet-switched data communication in wide area networks (WAN)**. It was originally defined by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, now ITU-T) in a series of drafts and finalized in a publication known as The Orange Book in 1976.
Networks using X.25 were popular during the late 1970s and 1980s with **telecommunications companies** and in **financial transaction systems** such as automated teller machines. An X.25 WAN consists of packet-switching exchange (PSE) nodes as the networking hardware, and leased lines, plain old telephone service connections, or ISDN connections as physical links. However, most users have moved to Internet Protocol (IP) systems instead. X.25 was used up to 2015 (e.g. by the credit card payment industry)[7] and is still used by aviation, purchasable from telecoms companies
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25

### Transport layer ###
- NCP - Network Control Protocol (1970) : First implementation for the ARPANET. Transport layer protocol used during the early ARPANET. Remained in use until 1982.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Control_Protocol_(ARPANET)
- **TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (1974)** : transmission of packets (reception is certain). Essential to the internet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol

### Application layer ###
- **FTP - File Transfer Protocol (1971)** : standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client–server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.
Until 1980, FTP ran on NCP, the predecessor of TCP/IP. Superseded by FTPS and SFTP.

- **G.711 (1972) : a narrowband audio codec** originally designed for use in telephony that provides toll-quality audio at 64 kbit/s. G.711 passes audio signals in the range of 300–3400 Hz and samples them at the rate of 8,000 samples per second, with the tolerance on that rate of 50 parts per million (ppm). Non-uniform (logarithmic) quantization with 8 bits is used to represent each sample, resulting in a 64 kbit/s bit rate. There are two slightly different versions: μ-law, which is used primarily in North America and Japan, and A-law, which is in use in most other countries outside North America.
G.711 is an ITU-T standard (Recommendation) for audio companding, titled **Pulse code modulation (PCM)** of voice frequencies released for use in 1972. It is a required standard in many technologies, such as in the H.320 and H.323 standards.[1] It can also be used for fax communication over IP networks (as defined in T.38 specification).
