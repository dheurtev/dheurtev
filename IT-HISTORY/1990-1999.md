# 1990s

## Telecommunications : Broadband internet ##
In the 1990s, with the advances of the Internet, leased lines were also used to **connect customer premises to ISP point of presence** 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leased_line

**ADSL**
Lechleider also believed this higher-speed standard would be much more attractive to customers than ISDN had proven. Unfortunately, at these speeds, the systems suffered from a type of crosstalk known as "NEXT", for "near-end crosstalk". This made longer connections on customer lines difficult. Lechleider noted that NEXT only occurred when similar frequencies were being used, and could be diminished if one of the directions used a different carrier rate, but doing so would reduce the potential bandwidth of that channel. Lechleider suggested that most consumer use would be asymmetric anyway, and that providing a high-speed channel towards the user and a lower speed return would be suitable for many uses.[6]
This work in the early 1990s eventually led to the ADSL concept, which emerged in 1995. An early supporter of the concept was Alcatel, who jumped on ADSL while many other companies were still devoted to ISDN. Krish Prabu stated that "Alcatel will have to invest one billion dollars in ADSL before it makes a profit, but it is worth it." They introduced the first DSL Access Multiplexers (DSLAM), the large multi-modem systems used at the telephony offices, and later introduced customer ADSL modems under the Thomson brand. Alcatel remained the primary vendor of ADSL systems for well over a decade.[7]
ADSL quickly replaced ISDN as the customer-facing solution for last-mile connectivity. ISDN has largely disappeared on the customer side, remaining in use only in niche roles like dedicated teleconferencing systems and similar legacy systems.

## Networking : IP traffic ##
**Transition to IP traffic**
Beginning in March 1991 the JANET IP Service (JIPS) was set up as a pilot project to host IP traffic on the existing network.[69] Within eight months the IP traffic had exceeded the levels of X.25 traffic, and the IP support became official in November. Also in 1991, Dai Davies introduced Internet technology over X.25 into the pan-European NREN, EuropaNet, although he experienced personal opposition to this approach.[70][71] The European Academic and Research Network (EARN) and RARE adopted IP around the same time,[nb 7] and the European Internet backbone EBONE became operational in 1992.[53] OSI usage on the NSFNET remained low when compared to TCP/IP. There was some talk of moving JANET to OSI protocols in the 1990s, but this never happened. The X.25 service was closed in August 1997

## Computers : Home computer, from GUI to web servers/browsers ##

### Evolution of mainframes ###
graphic display terminals, and terminal emulation became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with **GUIs**.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer

In 1991, AT&T Corporation briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. InfoWorld's Stewart Alsop infamously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe "will stop working on December 31, 1999",[20] a reference to the anticipated Year 2000 problem (Y2K).

## Standards, languages and protocols ##

### Network layer ###
- **IPv6 - Internet Protocol version 6 (1995)** : most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. 
Introduced in 1995, IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion, and is intended to replace IPv4.
In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF, which subsequently ratified it as an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.
Deployment was slowed by the widespread use of NAT (1999).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6
- **NAT - Network address translation (1999)** : a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
Popular with the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and home routers. Essential to networking.

#### Text ####
- **HTML (1990-1991): HyperText Markup Language**
In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. 
The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
- **XML (1998): Extensible Markup Language (XML)** is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related specifications[4]—all of them free open standards—define XML.[5]

#### Voice over IP ####
- **SIP - Session Initiation Protocol (1996)** : signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions that include voice, video and messaging applications. 
SIP is used in **Internet telephony**, in private IP telephone systems, as well as mobile phone calling over LTE (**VoLTE**). Essential to telecommunications.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol
#### Video over IP ####
- **H.323 (1996):** is a recommendation from the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) that defines the protocols to provide audio-visual communication sessions on any packet network.[1] The H.323 standard addresses call signaling and control, multimedia transport and control, and bandwidth control for point-to-point and multi-point conferences.[2]
It is widely implemented[3] by **voice and videoconferencing equipment manufacturers**, is used within various Internet real-time applications such as GnuGK and NetMeeting and is widely deployed worldwide by service providers and enterprises for both voice and video services over IP networks.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.323
#### Instant messaging ####
- **XMPP (1999)** : open communication protocol designed for **instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance**. enables the near-real-time exchange of structured data between two or more network entities. Widely in use.

#### Remote access ####
- **SSH - Secure Shell (1995): remote login and command-line execution** : The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.
SSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server
SSH was first designed in 1995 by Finnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen. Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is **OpenSSH**, released in **1999** as open-source software by the OpenBSD developers.
