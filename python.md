# Python tools

## Implementations ##
- [Python - CPython](https://www.python.org/): high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Cross-platform. Python Software Licence. [in use]
- [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/): ternative implementation of the Python programming language to CPython. PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy uses a just-in-time compiler. MIT License.

### Distributions ###
- [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/): distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Windows, Linux, Mac. Freemium. [in use]

### Data Science Libraries ###
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): web-based interactive computing platform. modified BSD license. [in use]
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. New BSD License. [past]
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. BSD. [past]
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/): free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. BSD-new license. [past]
- [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/): open-source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy into fast machine code using LLVM, via the llvmlite Python package
- [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html): Python package that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests. Modified BSD (3-clause) license
