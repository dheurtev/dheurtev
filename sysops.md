# My picks for system admin and operations (sysops)

Technologies I am using or used in recent years or considering.

## Best practices ##
- Avoid manual changes and GUI as leads to non-reproductible environment.
- Better to build and deploy server images often to avoid drift accumulation
- Immutable configuration to avoid configuration drift
- Infrastructure should be reproductible, disposable, consistent, with no end state
- Provisioning should be automated after the server starts.
- Do not store passwords in code. Use instead IAM or Vault. 
- Send and monitor logs
