# Typical Personal Computer specifications found during the PC golden age (circa 1992-2005)

The purpose of the summary table below is to help retrocomputing and retrogaming enthusiasts in their quest to recreate period accurate PCs using the [x86 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86).
It summarizes the typical hardware and software specifications for each PC architecture and period. 
The focus is on everyday computer buyers, including my own personal experience.

## A piece of advice
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**
- Image floppy disks and external media as soon as possible to preserve their content.
- Vacuum clean the dust on old hardware and replace thermal paste. 
- Do not expose old hardware directly to the internet without a strict firewall (bots are scanning for known security vulnerabilities).
- Use virtual machines instead of physical machines when installing new untrusted software sources, so you don't damage old hardware.
- Beware of viruses on floppy disks. Some may corrupt or kill your hardware.
- Keep games and other intensive applications to virtual machines to avoid overheating or damaging components.
- Running newer OS on older CPU architectures may be possible to some extent (+/- 10-15 years), but will cause performance (CPU speed and memory) issues.

## CPU architecture OS support
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

### Intel 286:
- IBM PC DOS
- OS/2 1.X
  
[Wikipedia page on 286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286)

### Intel 386: 
- Microsoft Windows, until Windows 95
- Debian (GNU/Linux), until 3.1 (2005)
- *"Among the BSDs, FreeBSD's 5.x releases were the last to support the 386; support for the 386SX was cut with release 5.2, while the remaining 386 support was removed with the 6.0 release in 2005. OpenBSD removed 386 support with version 4.2 (2007), DragonFly BSD with release 1.12 (2008), and NetBSD with the 5.0 release (2009)."* [Wikipedia - i386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) - [FreeBSD 5.x release notes](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.0R/relnotes-i386/)

### Intel 486:

*"The AMD Am5x86 and Cyrix Cx5x86 were the last i486 processors often used in late-generation i486 motherboards. They came with PCI slots and 72-pin SIMMs that were designed to run Windows 95, and also used for 80486 motherboards upgrades. While the Cyrix Cx5x86 faded when the Cyrix 6x86 took over, the AMD Am5x86 remained important given AMD K5 delays."*

*"Computers based on the i486 remained popular through the late 1990s, serving as low-end processors for entry-level PCs. Production for traditional desktop and laptop systems ceased in 1998, when Intel introduced the Celeron brand, though it continued to be produced for embedded systems through the late 2000s."*

*"In the general-purpose desktop computer role, i486-based machines remained in use into the early 2000s, especially as Windows 95 through 98 and Windows NT 4.0 were the last Microsoft operating systems to officially support i486-based systems. Windows 2000 could run on a i486-based machine, although with a less than optimal performance, due to the minimum hardware requirement of a Pentium processor"*

*"Linux 6 will likely be the last Linux kernel to support i486."*
