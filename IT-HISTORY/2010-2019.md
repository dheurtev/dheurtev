### Evolution of Hardware

- **iPad - first mass-market tablet computer (2010) - Apple**

A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and a rechargeable battery in a single, thin and flat package. Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones, the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally,[1][2][3][4] and may not support access to a cellular network.

The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen (stylus), instead of the mouse, touchpad, and keyboard of larger computers. Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards. Two species of tablet, the slate and booklet, do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays. To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB; 2-in-1 PCs have keyboards, distinct from tablets.

The form of the tablet was conceptualized in the middle of the 20th century (Stanley Kubrick depicted fictional tablets in the 1968 science fiction film A Space Odyssey) and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century. **In 2010, Apple released the iPad, the first mass-market tablet** to achieve widespread popularity.[5] Thereafter, tablets rapidly rose in ubiquity and soon became a large product category used for personal, educational and workplace applications,[6] with sales stabilizing in the mid-2010s.[7][8][9] Popular uses for a tablet PC include viewing presentations, video-conferencing, reading e-books, watching movies, sharing photos and more.[10]

- **SSD/RAM convergence (2010s)**

Since 2006, "solid-state drives" (based on flash memory) with capacities exceeding 256 gigabytes and performance far exceeding traditional disks have become available. This development has started to blur the definition between traditional random-access memory and "disks", dramatically reducing the difference in performance.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory

- **Northbridge merger into CPUs (2010s)**

In computing, a northbridge (also host bridge, or memory controller hub) is one of two chips comprising the core logic chipset architecture on a PC motherboard. A northbridge is connected directly to a CPU via the front-side bus (FSB) to handle high-performance tasks, and is usually used in conjunction with a slower southbridge[1] to manage communication between the CPU and other parts of the motherboard.[2] Since the 2010s, die shrink and improved transistor density have allowed for increasing chipset integration, and the functions performed by northbridges are now often incorporated into other components (like southbridges or CPUs themselves).[3][4] As of 2019, Intel and AMD had both released chipsets in which all northbridge functions had been integrated into the CPU.[4] Modern Intel Core processors have the northbridge integrated on the CPU die, where it is known as the uncore or system agent.

- **4K LCD monitors (2010) - Multiple manufacturers and 5K MacBookPro (2012) - Apple**

In 2010, 27-inch LCD monitors with the 2560 × 1440 resolution were released by multiple manufacturers, and in 2012, Apple introduced a 2880 × 1800 display on the MacBook Pro. Panels for professional environments, such as medical use and air traffic control, support resolutions up to 4096 × 2160[3] (or, more relevant for control rooms, 1∶1 2048 × 2048 pixels).[4][5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution

- **Retina display - High DPI display (2011) - Apple**

A trend of high DPI display was started in 2011 when Apple launched Retina display, which doubles number of pixels while keeping the size of screen elements. PC monitors and laptops did not adopt this trend quickly because of poor Windows scaling, certain elements retain their original size when you set screen scaling.

- **M.2 - Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF) connector (2012) - Intel**

M.2, pronounced m dot two[1] and formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a specification for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. M.2 replaces the mSATA standard, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical card layout and connectors. Employing a more flexible physical specification, M.2 allows different module widths and lengths, which, paired with the availability of more advanced interfacing features, makes M.2 more suitable than mSATA in general for solid-state storage applications, particularly in smaller devices such as ultrabooks and tablets.[2][3][4]

Computer bus interfaces provided through the M.2 connector are PCI Express 4.0 (up to four lanes), Serial ATA 3.0, and USB 3.0 (a single logical port for each of the latter two). It is up to the manufacturer of the M.2 host or module to select which interfaces are to be supported, depending on the desired level of host support and the module type. Different M.2 connector keying notches denote various purposes and capabilities of both the M.2 hosts and modules, and also prevent the M.2 modules from being inserted into incompatible host connectors.[2][3][5]

The M.2 specification supports NVM Express (NVMe) as the logical device interface for M.2 PCI Express SSDs, in addition to supporting legacy Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) at the logical interface level. While the support for AHCI ensures software-level backward compatibility with legacy SATA devices and legacy operating systems, NVM Express is designed to fully utilize the capability of high-speed PCI Express storage devices to perform many I/O operations in parallel.[2]: 14 [6]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2

M.2 was conceived as an successor of the mSATA interface and for the first time introduced by Intel in 2012 under the label Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF).

- **first players and discs for Ultra HD Blu-ray—a physical optical disc format supporting 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range video (HDR) (2016)**

In March 2016 the first players and discs for Ultra HD Blu-ray—a physical optical disc format supporting 4K resolution and high-dynamic-range video (HDR) at 60 frames per second—were released.[86]
On August 2, 2016, Microsoft released the Xbox One S, which supports 4K streaming and has an Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive, but does not support 4K gaming.[87] On November 10, 2016, Sony released the PlayStation 4 Pro, which supports 4K streaming and gaming,[88] though many games use checkerboard rendering or are upscaled 4K.[89] On November 7, 2017, Microsoft released the Xbox One X, which supports of 4K streaming and gaming,[90] though not all games are rendered at native 4K.[91]

- **Intel Ultra Path Interconnect (2017) - Intel**

The Intel Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI)[1][2] is a point-to-point processor interconnect developed by Intel which replaced the Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) in Xeon Skylake-SP platforms starting in 2017. UPI is a low-latency coherent interconnect for scalable multiprocessor systems with a shared address space. It uses a directory-based home snoop coherency protocol with a transfer speed of up to 10.4 GT/s. Supporting processors typically have two or three UPI links.
Comparing to QPI, it improves power efficiency with a new low-power state, improves transfer efficiency with a new packetization format, and improves scalability with protocol layer that does not require preallocation of resources. UPI only supports directory-based coherency, unlike previous QPI processors which supported multiple snoop modes (no snoop, early snoop, home snoop, and directory).
A combined caching and home agent (CHA) handles resolution of coherency across multiple processors, as well as snoop requests from processor cores and local and remote agents. Separate physical CHAs are placed within each processor core and last level cache (LLC) bank to improve scalability according to the number of cores, memory controllers, or the sub-NUMA clustering mode. The address space is interleaved across different CHAs, which act like a single logical agent.

- **first mobile phones with 8K video recording capabilities (2019)**

In May 2019, mobile phone vendors started releasing the first mobile phones with 8K video recording capabilities, such as the ZTE Nubia Red Magic 3 series.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_resolution#Resolutions

- **SSD size and speed growth (2010s)**

In 2016, Seagate demonstrated 10 GB/s sequential read and write speeds from a 16-lane PCIe 3.0 SSD, and a 60 TB SSD in a 3.5-inch form factor. Samsung also launched to market a 15.36 TB SSD with a price tag of US$10,000 using a SAS interface, using a 2.5-inch form factor but with the thickness of 3.5-inch drives. This was the first time a commercially available SSD had more capacity than the largest currently available HDD.[50][51][52][53][54]

In 2018, both Samsung and Toshiba launched 30.72 TB SSDs using the same 2.5-inch form factor but with 3.5-inch drive thickness using a SAS interface. Nimbus Data announced and reportedly shipped 100 TB drives using a SATA interface, a capacity HDDs are not expected to reach until 2025. Samsung introduced an M.2 NVMe SSD with read speeds of 3.5 GB/s and write speeds of 3.3 GB/s.[55][56][57][58][59][60][61] A new version of the 100 TB SSD was launched in 2020 at a price of US$40,000, with the 50 TB version costing US$12,500.[62][63]

In 2019, Gigabyte Technology demonstrated an 8 TB 16-lane PCIe 4.0 SSD with 15.0 GB/s sequential read and 15.2 GB/s sequential write speeds at Computex 2019. It included a fan, as new, high speed SSDs run at high temperatures.[64] Also in 2019, NVMe M.2 SSDs using the PCIe 4.0 interface were launched. These SSDs have read speeds of up to 5.0 GB/s and write speeds of up to 4.4 GB/s. Due to their high speed operation, these SSDs use large heatsinks and, without sufficient cooling airflow, will typically thermally throttle down after roughly 15 minutes of continuous operation at full speed.[65] Samsung also introduced SSDs capable of 8 GB/s sequential read and write speeds and 1.5 million IOPS, capable of moving data from damaged chips to undamaged chips, to allow the SSD to continue working normally, albeit at a lower capacity.[66][67][68].

- **Windows8 - Bluetooth Low Energy, Touchscreen, Windows Store, UEFI, ARM support (2012)**

Windows 8 introduced BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) mouse/HID support.[109]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse

Windows 8 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012; it was subsequently made available for download via MSDN and TechNet on August 15, 2012,[6] and later to retail on October 26, 2012.[7]
Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and user interface intended to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows was now competing with mobile operating systems, including Android and iOS.[8] In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's Metro design language and the Start screen, a new platform for developing apps with an emphasis on touchscreen input, integration with online services, and Windows Store, an online distribution for downloading and purchasing new software, and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots.[9] Many of these features were adopted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot on supported devices. Windows 8 is the first version of Windows to support the ARM architecture, under the Windows RT branding. Windows 8 removed support for non-SSE2 CPUs and devices without NX.

On April 11, 2013, Bulb TV created by Canadian serial entrepreneur Evan Kosiner became the first broadcaster to provide a 4K linear channel and VOD content to cable and satellite companies in North America.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution

### Video-on-demand

- **12K video on Youtube and Vimeo (2010)**

YouTube, since 2010,[62] and Vimeo allow a maximum upload resolution of 4096 × 3072 pixels (12.6 megapixels, aspect ratio 4:3).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution

- **4K on VOD - Netflix, Amazon (2014)**

In 2014, Netflix began streaming House of Cards, Breaking Bad,[82] and "some nature documentaries" at 4K to compatible televisions with an HEVC decoder. Most 4K televisions sold in 2013 did not natively support HEVC, with most major manufacturers announcing support in 2014.[83] Amazon Studios began shooting their full-length original series and new pilots with 4K resolution in 2014.[84] They are now currently available though Amazon Video.[85]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution

### Music

 In the 2010s, revenues from digital music services, such as iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube, matched those from physical format sales for the first time.[3] According to the RIAA's midyear report in 2020, phonograph record revenues surpassed those of CDs for the first time since the 1980s.

As of 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34% of music sales in the United States.[50] By 2015, only 24% of music in the United States was purchased on physical media, 2/3 of this consisting of CDs;[51] however, in the same year in Japan, over 80% of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats.[52] In 2018, U.S. CD sales were 52 million units—less than 6% of the peak sales volume in 2000.[46] In the UK 32 million units were sold, almost 100 million fewer than in 2008.[53]

During the 2010s, the increasing popularity of solid-state media and music streaming services caused automakers to remove automotive CD players in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs, wired connections to USB devices and wireless Bluetooth connections.[54] Automakers viewed CD players as using up valuable space and taking up weight which could be reallocated to more popular features, like large touchscreens.[55] By 2021, only Lexus and General Motors were still including CD players as standard equipment with certain vehicles.[55]

Despite rapidly declining sales year-over-year, the pervasiveness of the technology lingered for a time, with companies placing CDs in pharmacies, supermarkets, and filling station convenience stores to target buyers less likely to be able to use Internet-based distribution.[13] In 2018 Best Buy announced plans to decrease their focus on CD sales, however, while continuing to sell records, sales of which are growing during the vinyl revival.[56][57][58]

### Video games

- **XBox One - Shift to x86 and AMD architecture (2013) - Microsoft**

The third console, the Xbox One, was released in November 2013 and has sold 51 million units.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox

Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC-based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built around the x86-64 instruction set. Xbox One's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D-pad, and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing, as well as social networking features and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay or livestream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices. The console can play Blu-ray Disc, and overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide. The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the "Kinect 2.0", providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition.

- **Sony PlayStation 4 (2013) - Sony**

Sony's next console, the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling a million units within a day, becoming the fastest selling console in history

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation

The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth generation, it competes with Microsoft's Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch.

Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices ("Remote Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely ("Share Play"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.

The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embracing independent game development, and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as "significant" and "obvious". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second-best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2.

Its read-only optical drive is capable of reading Blu-ray Discs at speeds of up to three times that of its predecessor.[56][62] The console features a hardware on-the-fly zlib decompression module.[60] The original PS4 model supports up to 1080p and 1080i video standards,[63] while the Pro model supports 4K resolution.[64] The console includes a 500 gigabyte hard drive for additional storage,[65] which can be upgraded by the user.[66] System Software 4.50, which was released on March 9, 2017,[67] enabled the use of external USB hard drives up to 8 TB for additional storage.[68]

The PlayStation 4 features Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, Bluetooth, and two USB 3.0 ports.[23][56] An auxiliary port is also included for connection to the PlayStation Camera, a motion detection digital camera device first introduced on the PS3.[23] A mono headset, which can be plugged into the DualShock 4, is bundled with the system.[69] Audio/video output options include HDMI TV and optical S/PDIF audio.[23] The console does not have an analog audio/video output.[70]

The PS4 features a "Rest mode" feature. This places the console in a low-power state, while allowing users to immediately resume their game or app once the console is awoken. The console also is able to download content such as game and OS updates while it is in this state.[71][72]

**PlayStation VR is a virtual reality** system for PlayStation 4; it consists of a headset, which features a 1080p display panel, LED lights on the headset that are used by PlayStation Camera to track its motion, and a control box that processes 3D audio effects, as well as video output to the external display (either simulcasting the player's VR perspective, or providing an asymmetrical secondary perspective). PlayStation VR can also be used with PlayStation Move motion controllers.[90][91]

### Automation


## Some standards, languages and protocols

- **IEEE Std 1901-2010 - Broadband via electric power lines (2010)**

a standard for high speed (up to 500 Mbit/s at the physical layer) communication devices via electric power lines, often called broadband over power lines (BPL).[1] The standard uses transmission frequencies below 100 MHz. This standard is usable by all classes of BPL devices, including BPL devices used for the connection (<1500m to the premises) to Internet access services as well as BPL devices used within buildings for local area networks, smart energy applications, transportation platforms (vehicle), and other data distribution applications (<100m between devices).[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1901

### File compression

- **Snappy - High speed compression/decompression but lower compression (2011) - Google**

Snappy (previously known as Zippy) is a fast data compression and decompression library written in C++ by Google based on ideas from LZ77 and open-sourced in 2011.[2][3] It does not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. Compression speed is 250 MB/s and decompression speed is 500 MB/s using a single core of a circa 2011 "Westmere" 2.26 GHz Core i7 processor running in 64-bit mode. The compression ratio is 20–100% lower than gzip.[4]

Snappy is widely used in Google projects like Bigtable, MapReduce and in compressing data for Google's internal RPC systems. It can be used in open-source projects like MariaDB ColumnStore,[5] Cassandra, Couchbase, Hadoop, LevelDB, MongoDB, RocksDB, Lucene, Spark, and InfluxDB.[6] Decompression is tested to detect any errors in the compressed stream. Snappy does not use inline assembler (except some optimizations[7]) and is portable.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)

- **Zstandard, zstd - (2015) - Facebook**
Zstandard, commonly known by the name of its reference implementation zstd, is a lossless data compression algorithm developed by Yann Collet at Facebook. Zstd is the reference implementation in C. Version 1 of this implementation was released as open-source software on 31 August 2016.[3][4]

Zstandard was designed to give a compression ratio comparable to that of the DEFLATE algorithm (developed in 1991 and used in the original ZIP and gzip programs), but faster, especially for decompression. It is tunable with compression levels ranging from negative 7 (fastest)[5] to 22 (slowest in compression speed, but best compression ratio).

The Linux kernel has included Zstandard since November 2017 (version 4.14) as a compression method for the btrfs and squashfs filesystems.[16][17][18]

In 2017, Allan Jude integrated Zstandard into the FreeBSD kernel,[19] and it was subsequently integrated as a compressor option for core dumps (both user programs and kernel panics). It was also used to create a proof-of-concept OpenZFS compression method[7] which was integrated in 2020.[20]

The AWS Redshift and RocksDB databases include support for field compression using Zstandard.[21]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zstd


#### 3D

- **Vulkan - OpenGL successor (2015) - Khronos, AMD, DICE**

Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API, open standard for 3D graphics and computing.[16][17][18] Vulkan targets high-performance real-time 3D graphics applications, such as video games and interactive media. Vulkan is intended to offer higher performance and more efficient CPU and GPU usage compared to older OpenGL and Direct3D 11 APIs. It provides a considerably lower-level API for the application than the older APIs, making Vulkan comparable to Apple's Metal API and Microsoft's Direct3D 12. In addition to its lower CPU usage, Vulkan is designed to allow developers to better distribute work among multiple CPU cores.[19]

Vulkan was first announced by the non-profit Khronos Group at GDC 2015.[14][20][21] The Vulkan API was initially referred to as the "next generation OpenGL initiative", or "OpenGL next"[22] by Khronos, but use of those names was discontinued when Vulkan was announced.[23]

Vulkan is derived from and built upon components of AMD's Mantle API, which was donated by AMD to Khronos with the intent of giving Khronos a foundation on which to begin developing a low-level API that they could standardize across the industry.[14]

Vulkan is not backwards compatible with OpenGL,[24][18][note 1] although there exists within Mesa an implementation of OpenGL/GLES that runs on top of Vulkan, called Zink.[25]

## Navigation

- **U.S. GPS modernization**
On January 11, 2010, an update of ground control systems caused a software incompatibility with 8,000 to 10,000 military receivers manufactured by a division of Trimble Navigation Limited of Sunnyvale, Calif.[citation needed][67]

On February 25, 2010,[68] the U.S. Air Force awarded the contract[citation needed] to develop the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) to improve accuracy and availability of GPS navigation signals, and serve as a critical part of GPS modernization.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System

- **Europe's Galileo goes live (2016)**

Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016,[5] created by the European Union through the European Space Agency (ESA), operated by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA),[6] headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic,[7] with two ground operations centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The €10 billion project[4][8] is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time.[9] The use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services is free and open to everyone. A fully encrypted higher-precision service is available for free to government-authorized users.[10][11] Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre (3 ft 3 in) precision, and better positioning services at higher latitudes than other positioning systems. Galileo is also to provide a new global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the MEOSAR system.
