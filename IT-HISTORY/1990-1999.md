### Link layer

- **ATM - Asynchronous Transfer Mode**

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a telecommunications standard defined by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and ITU-T (formerly CCITT) for digital transmission of multiple types of traffic. ATM was developed to meet the needs of the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network as defined in the late 1980s,[1] and designed to integrate telecommunication networks. It can handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic and real-time, low-latency content such as telephony (voice) and video.[2][3] ATM provides functionality that uses features of circuit switching and packet switching networks by using asynchronous time-division multiplexing.[4][5]

In the OSI reference model data link layer (layer 2), the basic transfer units are called frames. In ATM these frames are of a fixed length (53 octets) called cells. This differs from approaches such as IP or Ethernet that use variable-sized packets or frames. ATM uses a connection-oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the data exchange begins.[5] These virtual circuits may be either permanent (dedicated connections that are usually preconfigured by the service provider), or switched (set up on a per-call basis using signaling and disconnected when the call is terminated).

The ATM network reference model approximately maps to the three lowest layers of the OSI model: physical layer, data link layer, and network layer.[6] ATM is a core protocol used in the SONET/SDH backbone of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and in the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) but has largely been superseded in favor of next-generation networks based on Internet Protocol (IP) technology. Wireless and mobile ATM never established a significant foothold.

ATM became popular with telephone companies and many computer makers in the 1990s. However, even by the end of the decade, the better price/performance of Internet Protocol-based products was competing with ATM technology for integrating real-time and bursty network traffic.[17] Companies such as FORE Systems focused on ATM products, while other large vendors such as Cisco Systems provided ATM as an option

### Network layer

- **IPv6 - Internet Protocol version 6 (1995)**

most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. 
Introduced in 1995, IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion, and is intended to replace IPv4.
In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF, which subsequently ratified it as an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.
Deployment was slowed by the widespread use of NAT (1999).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6

- **NAT - Network address translation (1999)** : a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
Popular with the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and home routers. Essential to networking. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation

### Transport layer

- **SSL - Secure Socket Layer (1995-1998)**

Netscape developed the original SSL protocols, and Taher Elgamal, chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998. Superseded by TLS.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security

- **TLS - Transport Layer Security (1999)** 

A cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used 
in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.
Essential to networking and the internet.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security

- **PPTP - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (1999) - Microsoft**

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks. PPTP has many well known security issues.

PPTP uses a TCP control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel to encapsulate PPP packets. Many modern VPNs use various forms of UDP for this same functionality.

The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication features and relies on the Point-to-Point Protocol being tunneled to implement any and all security functionalities.

The PPTP implementation that ships with the Microsoft Windows product families implements various levels of authentication and encryption natively as standard features of the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this protocol is to provide security levels and remote access levels comparable with typical VPN products.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Tunneling_Protocol

### Session layer

- **SOCKS - SOCKS4 (1992) - SOCKS5 (1996)**

SOCKS is a de facto standard for circuit-level gateways (level 5 gateways).[6]

The circuit/session level nature of SOCKS make it a versatile tool in forwarding any TCP (or UDP since SOCKS5) traffic, creating an interface for all types of routing tools. It can be used as:

A circumvention tool, allowing traffic to bypass Internet filtering to access content otherwise blocked, e.g., by governments, workplaces, schools, and country-specific web services.[7] Since SOCKS is very detectable, a common approach is to present a SOCKS interface for more sophisticated protocols:
The Tor onion proxy software presents a SOCKS interface to its clients.[8]

Providing similar functionality to a virtual private network, allowing connections to be forwarded to a server's "local" network:
Some SSH suites, such as OpenSSH, support dynamic port forwarding that allows the user to create a local SOCKS proxy.[9] This can free the user from the limitations of connecting only to a predefined remote port and server.

The protocol was originally developed/designed by David Koblas, a system administrator of MIPS Computer Systems. After MIPS was taken over by Silicon Graphics in 1992, Koblas presented a paper on SOCKS at that year's Usenix Security Symposium,[2] making SOCKS publicly available.[3] The protocol was extended to version 4 by Ying-Da Lee of NEC.

The SOCKS reference architecture and client are owned by Permeo Technologies,[4] a spin-off from NEC. (Blue Coat Systems bought out Permeo Technologies, and were in turn acquired by Symantec.)

The SOCKS5 protocol was originally a security protocol that made firewalls and other security products easier to administer. It was approved by the IETF in 1996 as RFC 1928 (authored by: M. Leech, M. Ganis, Y. Lee, R. Kuris, D. Koblas, and L. Jones). The protocol was developed in collaboration with Aventail Corporation, which markets the technology outside of Asia.[5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS

### Application layer

- **HTTP/0.9 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (1991)**

application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. Essential to the internet.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol

- **DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (1991)** 

A network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a client–server architecture.
Essential to networking.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol

- **RADIUS (1991)**

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol. It was later brought into IEEE 802 and IETF standards.

RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP. Network access servers, which control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server.[1] RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication.[2] A RADIUS server is usually a background process running on UNIX or Microsoft Windows.[1]
As more dial-up customers used the NSFNET a request for proposal was sent out by Merit Network in 1991 to consolidate their various proprietary authentication, authorization and accounting systems. Among the early respondents was Livingston Enterprises and an early version of the RADIUS was written after a meeting. The early RADIUS server was installed on a UNIX operating system. Livingston Enterprises was acquired by Lucent and together with Merit steps were taken to gain industry acceptance for RADIUS as a protocol. Both companies offered a RADIUS server at no charge.[11] In 1997 RADIUS was published as RFC 2058 and RFC 2059, current versions are RFC 2865 and RFC 2866.[12]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS

- **LDAP (1993)**

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP /ˈɛldæp/) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.[1] Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network.[2] As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.
LDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track publications called Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1. The latest specification is Version 3, published as RFC 4511[3] (a road map to the technical specifications is provided by RFC4510).
A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.[4]
LDAP is based on a simpler subset of the standards contained within the X.500 standard. Because of this relationship, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite.[5]
The protocol was originally created[7] by Tim Howes of the University of Michigan, Steve Kille of Isode Limited, Colin Robbins of Nexor and Wengyik Yeong of Performance Systems International, circa 1993, as a successor[8] to DIXIE and DAS. Mark Wahl of Critical Angle Inc., Tim Howes, and Steve Kille started work in 1996 on a new version of LDAP, LDAPv3, under the aegis of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). LDAPv3, first published in 1997, superseded LDAPv2 and added support for extensibility, integrated the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, and better aligned the protocol to the 1993 edition of X.500. Further development of the LDAPv3 specifications themselves and of numerous extensions adding features to LDAPv3 has come through the IETF.

### Data transmission

#### Text

- **HTML (1990-1991) - HyperText Markup Language**

In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. 
The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML

- **URL (1992-1994) - Uniform Resource Locators**

Uniform Resource Locators were defined in RFC 1738 in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and the URI working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),[7] as an outcome of collaboration started at the IETF Living Documents birds of a feather session in 1992.[7][8]

#### Images

- **WMF - Windows Metafile, SVG ancestor (1991) - Microsoft**

Long before the invention of Scalable Vector Graphics, Microsoft Corporation recognized the value of recording images in a format that its applications and operating systems could easily render irrespective of the output device.  With the release of Windows 3.0, Microsoft released its Windows Metafile (WMF) format, which can contain vector and raster graphics in one package.

PNG was published as informational RFC 2083 in March 1997 and as an ISO/IEC 15948 standard in 2004

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics

#### Music and Video

- **RIFF - Resource Interchange File Format (1991) - Microsoft and IBM**

The Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is a generic file container format for storing data in tagged chunks.[2] It is primarily used to store multimedia such as sound and video, though it may also be used to store any arbitrary data.[3]
The Microsoft implementation is mostly known through container formats like AVI, ANI and WAV, which use RIFF as their basis.[4]
RIFF was introduced in 1991 by Microsoft and IBM, and was presented by Microsoft as the default format for Windows 3.1 multimedia files. It is based on Electronic Arts' Interchange File Format, introduced in 1985 on the Commodore Amiga, the only difference being that multi-byte integers are in little-endian format, native to the 80x86 processor series used in IBM PCs, rather than the big-endian format native to the 68k processor series used in Amiga and Apple Macintosh computers, where IFF files were heavily used. A RIFX format, which is big-endian, was also introduced.

- **Quicktime (1991-2018) - Apple**

QuickTime is an extensible multimedia framework developed by Apple Inc., capable of handling various formats of digital video, picture, sound, panoramic images, and interactivity. Created in 1991, the latest Mac version, QuickTime X, is available for Mac OS X Snow Leopard up to macOS Mojave. Apple ceased support for the Windows version of QuickTime in 2016, and ceased support for QuickTime 7 on macOS in 2018

Apple released the first version of QuickTime on December 2, 1991 as a multimedia add-on for System 6 and later. The lead developer of QuickTime, Bruce Leak, ran the first public demonstration at the May 1991 Worldwide Developers Conference, where he played Apple's famous 1984 advertisement in a window at 320×240 pixels resolution.

QuickTime 1.x

The original video codecs included:
  * the Animation codec, which used run-length encoding and was better suited to cartoon-type images with large areas of flat color
  * the Apple Video codec (also known as "Road Pizza"), suited to normal live-action video.[32]
  * the Graphics codec, for 8-bit images, including ones that had undergone dithering
The first commercial project produced using QuickTime 1.0 was the CD-ROM From Alice to Ocean. The first publicly visible use of QuickTime was Ben & Jerry's interactive factory tour (dubbed The Rik & Joe Show after its in-house developers). The Rik and Joe Show was demonstrated onstage at MacWorld in San Francisco when John Sculley announced QuickTime.[33]

Apple released QuickTime 1.5 for Mac OS in the latter part of 1992. This added the SuperMac-developed Cinepak vector-quantization video codec (initially known as Compact Video). It could play video at 320×240 resolution at 30 frames per second on a 25 MHz Motorola 68040 CPU. It also added text tracks, which allowed for captioning, lyrics and other potential uses.

It was followed by several version (up to version 7 and X) in the 2000s and 2010s.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime


- **WAV - Uncompressed sound format (1991) - Microsoft and IBM**

Waveform Audio File Format[3] (WAVE,[3] or WAV due to its filename extension;[3][6][7] pronounced "wave"[8]) is an audio file format standard, developed by IBM and Microsoft, for storing an audio bitstream on PCs. It is the main format used on Microsoft Windows systems for uncompressed audio. The usual bitstream encoding is the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format.
WAV is an application of the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) bitstream format method for storing data in chunks, and thus is similar to the 8SVX and the AIFF format used on Amiga and Macintosh computers, respectively.
August 1991

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV

- **AVI - Audio Video Interleave (1992) - Microsoft**

Audio Video Interleave (also Audio Video Interleaved and known by its initials and filename extension AVI, usually pronounced /ˌeɪ.viːˈaɪ/[3]), is a proprietary multimedia container format and Windows standard[4] introduced by Microsoft in November 1992 as part of its Video for Windows software. AVI files can contain both audio and video data in a file container that allows synchronous audio-with-video playback. Like the DVD video format, AVI files support multiple streaming audio and video, although these features are seldom used.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave

- **MP3 (1993)**

MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III)[4] is a coding format for digital audio developed largely by the Fraunhofer Society in Germany, with support from other digital scientists in the United States and elsewhere. Originally defined as the third audio format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further extended — defining additional bit-rates and support for more audio channels — as the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard. A third version, known as MPEG 2.5 — extended to better support lower bit rates — is commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.
On 7 July 1994, the Fraunhofer Society released the first software MP3 encoder, called l3enc.[59] The filename extension .mp3 was chosen by the Fraunhofer team on 14 July 1995 (previously, the files had been named .bit).[1] With the first real-time software MP3 player WinPlay3 (released 9 September 1995) many people were able to encode and play back MP3 files on their PCs. Because of the relatively small hard drives of the era (≈500–1000 MB) lossy compression was essential to store multiple albums' worth of music on a home computer as full recordings (as opposed to MIDI notation, or tracker files which combined notation with short recordings of instruments playing single notes).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3

#### File compression

- **DEFLATE (1993-1996)**

In computing, Deflate (stylized as DEFLATE) is a lossless data compression file format that uses a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. It was designed by Phil Katz, for version 2 of his PKZIP archiving tool. Deflate was later specified in RFC 1951 (1996).[1]

Katz also designed the original algorithm used to construct Deflate streams. This algorithm was patented as U.S. Patent 5,051,745, and assigned to PKWARE, Inc.[2][3] As stated in the RFC document, an algorithm producing Deflate files was widely thought to be implementable in a manner not covered by patents.[1] This led to its widespread use – for example, in gzip compressed files and PNG image files, in addition to the ZIP file format for which Katz originally designed it. The patent has since expired.

- **Winzip - Popular ZIP Gui on Windows (1991)** 

WinZip is a trialware file archiver and compressor for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android. It is developed by WinZip Computing (formerly Nico Mak Computing), which is owned by Corel Corporation. The program can create archives in Zip file format, unpack some other archive file formats and it also has various tools for system integration.

WinZip 1.0 was released in April 1991 as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) front-end for PKZI.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinZip

- **ARJ (1993)**

ARJ (Archived by Robert Jung) is a software tool designed by Robert K. Jung for creating high-efficiency compressed file archives. ARJ is currently on version 2.86 for MS-DOS and 3.20 for Microsoft Windows and supports 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit Intel architectures.[1]

ARJ was one of many file compression utilities for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows during the early and mid-1990s. Parts of ARJ were covered by U.S. Patent 5,140,321 (expired). ARJ is well-documented and includes over 150 command line switches.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARJ

- **RAR (1993)**

RAR is a proprietary archive file format that supports data compression, error correction and file spanning.[3] It was developed in 1993 by Russian software engineer Eugene Roshal and the software is licensed by win.rar GmbH.[3] The name RAR stands for Roshal Archive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR_(file_format)

- **7ZIP - 7z file format, ZIP improvement (1999) - Igor Pavlov**

7-Zip is a free and open-source file archiver, a utility used to place groups of files within compressed containers known as "archives". It is developed by Igor Pavlov and was first released in 1999.[2] 7-Zip has its own archive format called 7z, but can read and write several others.

By default, 7-Zip creates 7z-format archives with a .7z file extension.

In 2011, TopTenReviews found that the 7z compression was at least 17% better than ZIP,[17] and 7-Zip's own site has since 2002 reported that while compression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests, "Usually, 7-Zip compresses to 7z format 30–70% better than to zip format, and 7-Zip compresses to zip format 2–10% better than most other zip-compatible programs."[18

#### Voice over IP

- **SIP - Session Initiation Protocol (1996)** 

Signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions that include voice, video and messaging applications. 
SIP is used in **Internet telephony**, in private IP telephone systems, as well as mobile phone calling over LTE (**VoLTE**). Essential to telecommunications.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol

#### Video over IP

- **MPEG-1 (1993)**

Since 1972, International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) had been working on creating a global recommendation for Analog HDTV. These recommendations, however, did not fit in the broadcasting bands which could reach home users. The standardization of MPEG-1 in 1993 led to the acceptance of recommendations ITU-R BT.709

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television

- **MPEG-2 (1995)**

MPEG-2 evolved out of the shortcomings of MPEG-1.
MPEG-1's known weaknesses:
An audio compression system limited to two channels (stereo).
No standardized support for interlaced video with poor compression when used for interlaced video
Only one standardized "profile" (Constrained Parameters Bitstream), which was unsuited for higher resolution video. MPEG-1 could support 4k video but there was no easy way to encode video for higher resolutions, and identify hardware capable of supporting it, as the limitations of such hardware were not defined.
Support for only one chroma subsampling, 4:2:0.
Sakae Okubo of NTT was the ITU-T coordinator for developing the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 video coding standard and the requirements chairman in MPEG for the MPEG-2 set of standards.[27] The majority of patents underlying MPEG-2 technology are owned by three companies: Sony (311 patents), Thomson (198 patents) and Mitsubishi Electric (119 patents).[28] Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) developed the first MPEG-2 SAVI (System/Audio/Video) decoder in 1995.[29]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2

- **H.323 (1996)** 

Recommendation from the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) that defines the protocols to provide audio-visual communication sessions on any packet network.[1] The H.323 standard addresses call signaling and control, multimedia transport and control, and bandwidth control for point-to-point and multi-point conferences.[2]
It is widely implemented[3] by **voice and videoconferencing equipment manufacturers**, is used within various **Internet real-time applications** such as GnuGK and NetMeeting and is widely deployed worldwide by service providers and enterprises for both voice and video services over IP networks.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.323

- **H.263 (1996)**

The H.263 standard was first designed to be utilized in H.324 based systems (PSTN and other **circuit-switched network videoconferencing and videotelephony)**, but it also found use in H.323 (RTP/IP-based videoconferencing), H.320 (ISDN-based videoconferencing, where it became the most widely used video compression standard),[4] RTSP (streaming media) and SIP (IP-based videoconferencing) solutions.

- **CORBA - Common Object Request Broker Architecture (1991)**

The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on diverse platforms. CORBA enables collaboration between systems on different operating systems, programming languages, and computing hardware. CORBA uses an object-oriented model although the systems that use the CORBA do not have to be object-oriented. CORBA is an example of the distributed object paradigm.

CORBA enables communication between software written in different languages and running on different computers. Implementation details from specific operating systems, programming languages, and hardware platforms are all removed from the responsibility of developers who use CORBA. CORBA normalizes the method-call semantics between application objects residing either in the same address-space (application) or in remote address-spaces (same host, or remote host on a network). Version 1.0 was released in October 1991.

- **XML (1998) - Extensible Markup Language**

A markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related specifications[4]—all of them free open standards—define XML.[5]

#### Files

- **CIFS (1996) - Microsoft**

In 1996, Microsoft published a version of SMB 1.0[4] with minor modifications under the Common Internet File System (CIFS /sɪfs/) moniker. CIFS was compatible with even the earliest incarnation of SMB, including LAN Manager's.[4] It supports symbolic links, hard links, and larger file size, but none of the features of SMB 2.0 and later.[4][5] Microsoft's proposal, however, remained an Internet Draft and never achieved standard status.[6] Microsoft has since discontinued use of the CIFS moniker but continues developing SMB and making subsequent specifications publicly available.

#### Remote access
- **SSH - Secure Shell (1995): remote login and command-line execution**

The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution.
SSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server
SSH was first designed in 1995 by Finnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen. Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is **OpenSSH**, released in **1999** as open-source software by the OpenBSD developers.

- **OpenGL (1991) - Silicon Graphics**

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library[3]) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) began developing OpenGL in 1991 and released it on June 30, 1992;[4][5] applications use it extensively in the fields of computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation, and video games. Since 2006, OpenGL has been managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group.[6]

- **DirectX (1995)**

Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with "Direct", such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth. The name DirectX was coined as a shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology.[3] The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.

Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox line of consoles. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names "DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably.

The DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.[4] Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples. Starting with the release of Windows 8 Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK.[5]

- **Direct3D (1996) - Microsoft**

Direct3D is a graphics application programming interface (API) for Microsoft Windows. Part of DirectX, Direct3D is used to render three-dimensional graphics in applications where performance is important, such as games. Direct3D uses hardware acceleration if it is available on the graphics card, allowing for hardware acceleration of the entire 3D rendering pipeline or even only partial acceleration. Direct3D exposes the advanced graphics capabilities of 3D graphics hardware, including Z-buffering,[1] W-buffering,[2] stencil buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, alpha blending, color blending, mipmapping, texture blending,[3][4] clipping, culling, atmospheric effects, perspective-correct texture mapping, programmable HLSL shaders[5] and effects.[6] Integration with other DirectX technologies enables Direct3D to deliver such features as video mapping, hardware 3D rendering in 2D overlay planes, and even sprites, providing the use of 2D and 3D graphics in interactive media ties.

- **Unreal Engine (1998) - Unreal**

Unreal Engine (UE) is a 3D computer graphics game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter game Unreal. Initially developed for PC first-person shooters, it has since been used in a variety of genres of games and has seen adoption by other industries, most notably the film and television industry. Written in C++, the Unreal Engine features a high degree of portability, supporting a wide range of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms.

### Automation
- **LonWork (1999)** 

LonWorks or Local Operating Network is an open standard (ISO/IEC 14908) for networking platforms specifically created to address the needs of control applications. The platform is built on a protocol created by Echelon Corporation for networking devices over media such as twisted pair, powerlines, fibre optics , and RF. It is used for the automation of various functions within buildings such as lighting and HVAC; see building automation.
The technology has its origins with chip designs, power line and twisted pair, signaling technology, routers, network management software, and other products from Echelon Corporation. In 1999 the communications protocol (then known as LonTalk) was submitted to ANSI and accepted as a standard for control networking (ANSI/CEA-709.1-B). Echelon's power line and twisted pair signaling technology was also submitted to ANSI for standardization and accepted. Since then, ANSI/CEA-709.1 has been accepted as the basis for IEEE 1473-L (in-train controls), AAR electro-pneumatic braking systems for freight trains, IFSF (European petrol station control), SEMI (semiconductor equipment manufacturing), and in 2005 as EN 14908 (European building automation standard). The protocol is also one of several data link/physical layers of the BACnet ASHRAE/ANSI standard for building automation.
China ratified the technology as a national controls standard, GB/Z 20177.1-2006 and as a building and intelligent community standard, GB/T 20299.4-2006; and in 2007 CECED, the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers, adopted the protocol as part of its Household Appliances Control and Monitoring – Application Interworking Specification (AIS) standards.
During 2008 ISO and IEC have granted the communications protocol, twisted pair signaling technology, power line signaling technology, and Internet Protocol (IP) compatibility standard numbers ISO/IEC 14908-1, -2, -3, and -4.[1]

**GPS is operational, military use, miniaturization and shift to dual-use**

The Gulf War from 1990 to 1991 was the first conflict in which the military widely used GPS.[58]

In 1991, a project to create a miniature GPS receiver successfully ended, replacing the previous 16 kg (35 lb) military receivers with a 1.25 kg (2.8 lb) handheld receiver.[26]

In 1992, the 2nd Space Wing, which originally managed the system, was inactivated and replaced by the 50th Space Wing.

By December 1993, GPS achieved initial operational capability (IOC), with a full constellation (24 satellites) available and providing the Standard Positioning Service (SPS).[59]

Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in April 1995, signifying full availability of the military's secure Precise Positioning Service (PPS).[59]

In 1996, recognizing the importance of GPS to civilian users as well as military users, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued a policy directive[60] declaring GPS a dual-use system and establishing an Interagency GPS Executive Board to manage it as a national asset.

In 1998, United States Vice President Al Gore announced plans to upgrade GPS with two new civilian signals for enhanced user accuracy and reliability, particularly with respect to aviation safety, and in 2000 the United States Congress authorized the effort, referring to it as GPS III.
