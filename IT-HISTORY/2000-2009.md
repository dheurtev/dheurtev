**SATA**
SATA was announced in 2000[5][6] in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol. Revision 1.0 of the specification was released in January 2003.[3]
Serial ATA (SATA, abbreviated from Serial AT Attachment)[3] is a computer bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. Serial ATA succeeded the earlier Parallel ATA (PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices.
Serial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the Serial ATA International Organization (SATA-IO) which are then promulgated by the INCITS Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).

The popular widescreen format (16:10) appeared in 2004 originally in laptops (14″ / 15″ had 1280×800, 17″ had 1440×900), next year desktop monitors appeared in this format (19″ 1440×900, 22″ 1680×1050, 24″ 1920×1200) and high-end laptops received such resolutions. Widescreen monitors come with VGA and DVI ports, running 4:3 resolutions on VGA cable will make image stretching on full screen, while DVI cable maintain aspect ratio and display black bars.

Television industry adopted 16:9 standard in 2008, and because is cheaper to produce both monitors and TV with same aspect ratio, 14″ / 15″ laptops became 1366×768, 17″ laptops became 1600×900, high-end laptops ($1000+) used 1920×1080. New desktop monitors were 18.5″ 1366×768, 20″ 1600×900, 21.5″ / 23″ 1920×1080. QHD, 27″ 2560×1440 appeared in 2009. LG G3 was in 2013 first smartphone with QHD display. Mini-laptops with 10″ screens used 1024×600, called netbooks (smaller than 14-17″ notebooks).
